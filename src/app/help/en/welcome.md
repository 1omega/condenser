## Welcome to Steemit!

***

This page is full of information to help you learn about the platform and become a successful Steemian.

***

### 1. Backup your password

Unlike centralized web services, **it is not possible to recover lost passwords on the Steem blockchain**.

You are entirely responsible for saving your password, backing it up, and keeping it secure.  
Never put your password into unverified third party websites as they may steal your account.


### 2. Really, backup your password!

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password
somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity.
Consider digital offline storage (such as a flash drive or burned CD),
secure private cloud-based storage, as well as printed paper.


### 3. Some ground rules

1. It is free to post, comment, and vote on all content at Steemit.com.
2. Do not plagiarize, and be sure to cite sources, including copyrighted images.


### 3. Update your profile

You can update your profile on the Settings page.
This includes your display name, location, about information, and website.
Once you have made all your changes, click the "Update" button to save your profile.


### 4. Create your "Introduceyourself" Post

While not required, the tradition for new users is to create an
"introduceyourself" post in order to let the community get to know you.

If you have other social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) you can help
the community verify that you are who you say you are by sharing the link to
your Steem profile on them.
If you are claiming to be someone famous, this is pretty much expected.


### 5. Sign up for Steem Chat

A lot of users mingle and chat in [steem.chat](https://steem.chat/) when they
are not posting or browsing Steemit. It is a great place to meet people!

Your [steem.chat](https://steem.chat/home) account is a separate account from
your Steem account. There is a link to sign up in the main menu in the upper right corner.
Ask your general questions in the [help](https://steem.chat/channel/help)
channel of [steem.chat](https://steem.chat/home). Users in the channel will
typically respond to questions within a few hours. Each channel will have its
rules posted in the "Room Info" section.

New Member Support Community is a group of people dedicated to helping new
users find their way around Steemit. You can find them in the
[New Member Support Community](https://discord.gg/HYj4yvw) channel of Discord Chat.
